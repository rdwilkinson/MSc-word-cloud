# What does the script do?
Creates a wordcloud PNG from my MSc in Social Research (2019-20) submissions (approx. 50,000 words).

* Imports MSc submission files (docx)
* Cleans text (stopwords, short words, etc.)
* Does some basic stemming (custom loop)
* Outputs wordcloud that is saved as a PNG file via a webpage 

# What resources does it use?
Followed various online tutorials to use the wordcloud2 package in R. Began with: https://towardsdatascience.com/create-a-word-cloud-with-r-bde3e7422e8a. Used many answers to stackexchange questions (URLs are quoted in the script). The final wordcloud also uses the attractive 'Caveat' font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?category=Handwriting&preview.text_type=custom#license
